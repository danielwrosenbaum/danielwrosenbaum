## About Me

I'm a musician and painter with a life-long passion for computers, software and all things tech. I've been a creative all my life and my love for creating and learning new things has led me to pursuing a career in software and web development.

Computers have fascinated me since a young age and I've always enjoyed discovering how new machines and programs work. As a musician, I became very familiar with programs like Pro Tools and Logic pro, while as an artist, Adobe's Creative Suite opened up an exciting new world of digital creation. Software and web development seemed like the logical next step for me and so I spent months learning code on my own using websites like CodeAcademy and freeCodeCamp.

After working on my own for awhile I found I really enjoyed learning code and wanted to take it more seriously. I spent hours searching for the right school before finding LearningFuze and I'm so glad I did. Web Development has been such a wonderful outlet for me and I love the feeling of being challenged by new material and technology. My goal is to pursue a career in coding for many years to come, while always maintaining that desire to constantly be learning and creating.

I started small with a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript but by the end of the course I was developing full-stack applications utilizing React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, among others. React in particular opened up a world of programming that I have thoroughly enjoyed and am greatly looking forward to expanding my capabilities as my development knowledge grows.
