## About Me

I'm a musician and painter with a life-long passion for computers, software and all things tech. I've been a creative all my life and my love for creating and learning new things has led me to pursuing a career in software and web development.

I landed in Los Angeles with an English Degree and a desire to play music professionally. After hundreds of shows around Southern California and several nation-wide tours, I found myself seeking more professional stability while still hoping to stretch my creative muscles. Those impulses led me into the world of letterpress printing - an industry and trade that I previously knew nothing about.

I've always had a love for learning new things and figuring out how to make things work. Letterpress printing fulfilled both those passions as I learned how to operate machines built in the 1940s and 1950s to handprint ink and foil onto paper. Since these machines were so old and often didn't come with manuals, I learned to troubleshoot and improvise as I went along, developing a highly specialized skillset that was always fascinating and rewarding. After 7 years in the industry, however, the physical toll of working with heavy machinery and being on my feet all day led me to seek a new outlet for my creativity and knack for problem-solving.

Computers have fascinated me since a young age and I've always enjoyed discovering how new machines and programs work. As a musician, I became very familiar with programs like Pro Tools and Logic pro, while as an artist, Adobe's Creative Suite opened up an exciting new world of digital creation. Software and web development seemed like the logical next step for me and so I spent months learning code on my own using websites like CodeAcademy and freeCodeCamp.

After working on my own for awhile I found I really enjoyed learning code and wanted to take it more seriously. I spent hours searching for the right school before finding LearningFuze and I'm so glad I did. Web Development has been such a wonderful outlet for me and I love the feeling of being challenged by new material and technology. My goal is to pursue a career in coding for many years to come, while always maintaining that desire to constantly be learning and creating.
